Yap, let's talk about corporate standardization. All those big architects just need to come up with them, some might be useful, others just fail. "Let's have all the UI standardized, we need all our apps look similar!", "Let's use this technology all over the projects, let's not use this and this!". This is a kind of standards that are doomed to fail and a lot of money is going to be thrown away. So how do we wisely choose standards? What should we do in order not to get into a trap of costy standards that are impossible to implement.

First problem with standards is people have to know them in order to follow. And new joiners don't know corporate standards.
